"""Reference stub agents that bound and calibrate the metric.

* :class:`OracleAgent` — reads ground truth, posts the gold adjustments. Ceiling: 1.0.
* :class:`NullAgent` — does nothing. Floor: low.
* :class:`BaselineAgent` — an honest rule-based reconciler using ONLY the session
  tools (never ground truth). It ties the ledger to the bank statement and applies
  mechanical fixes, but has a realistic blind spot (policy-driven accruals), so it
  lands mid-scale. It doubles as the executable proof that instances are solvable
  from the documents alone.
* :class:`SloppyAgent` — forces the books to tie by dumping the unreconciled
  difference into an untouched clearing account, tripping the ``unauthorized_change``
  gate. Demonstrates why the gates exist: decent raw score, final score 0.

A real LLM agent implements the same ``run(session, gt=None)`` protocol, using only
the tools on ``session``.
